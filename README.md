# Django-Website
A very minimal list website I built in Django.

# Run The Website
This website requires a few python packages:
- django
- django-crispy-forms

To run the website navigate to upper level "mysite" directory and run the command via cmd: *python manage.py runserver*
Then you should see a local host link that you can copy into your browser to see the website.
